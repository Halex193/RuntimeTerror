# Short presentation

The objective of the Conference Management System is to automate the management of information for a scientific conference and simplify the processes related to it.  

These include, but are not limited to:
- **Publicly displaying the conference information in an accessible manner**, like the conference name, interval, program committee members, details of the sections and papers that are going to be presented
- **Managing the submission of papers by authors**, with support for uploading `.pdf` or `.docx` files and specifying metadata and multiple authors
- **Reviewing of the papers by the chosen program committee**, with the option for them to bid on the papers before they are assigned to review them
- **Refining the paper as an author taking into account the received reviews** and also uploading a different `.pptx` file for the actual presentation
- **Changing the public conference details as a Steering Committee member** and managing its sections
